  abstract = 	 {We propose a novel parameterized skill-learning algorithm that aims to learn transferable parameterized skills and synthesize them into a new action space that supports efficient learning in long-horizon tasks. We propose to leverage off-policy Meta-RL combined with a trajectory-centric smoothness term to learn a set of parameterized skills. Our agent can use these learned skills to construct a three-level hierarchical framework that models a Temporally-extended Parameterized Action Markov Decision Process. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithms enable an agent to solve a set of highly difficult long-horizon (obstacle-course and robot manipulation) tasks.}

 DOI={10.1609/aaai.v37i7.26073}, 
 abstractNote={We present Q-functionals, an alternative architecture for continuous control deep reinforcement learning. Instead of returning a single value for a state-action pair, our network transforms a state into a function that can be rapidly evaluated in parallel for many actions, allowing us to efficiently choose high-value actions through sampling. This contrasts with the typical architecture of off-policy continuous control, where a policy network is trained for the sole purpose of selecting actions from the Q-function. We represent our action-dependent Q-function as a weighted sum of basis functions (Fourier, Polynomial, etc) over the action space, where the weights are state-dependent and output by the Q-functional network. Fast sampling makes practical a variety of techniques that require Monte-Carlo integration over Q-functions, and enables action-selection strategies besides simple value-maximization. We characterize our framework, describe various implementations of Q-functionals, and demonstrate strong performance on a suite of continuous control tasks.}, number={7}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},

abstract = {Despite the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, state-of-the-art systems lack robustness to “real world” events, where the input distributions and tasks encountered by the deployed systems will not be limited to the original training context, and systems will instead need to adapt to novel distributions and tasks while deployed. This critical gap may be addressed through the development of “Lifelong Learning” systems that are capable of (1) Continuous Learning, (2) Transfer and Adaptation, and (3) Scalability. Unfortunately, efforts to improve these capabilities are typically treated as distinct areas of research that are assessed independently, without regard to the impact of each separate capability on other aspects of the system. We instead propose a holistic approach, using a suite of metrics and an evaluation framework to assess Lifelong Learning in a principled way that is agnostic to specific domains or system techniques. Through five case studies, we show that this suite of metrics can inform the development of varied and complex Lifelong Learning systems. We highlight how the proposed suite of metrics quantifies performance trade-offs present during Lifelong Learning system development — both the widely discussed Stability-Plasticity dilemma and the newly proposed relationship between Sample Efficient and Robust Learning. Further, we make recommendations for the formulation and use of metrics to guide the continuing development of Lifelong Learning systems and assess their progress in the future.}

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
